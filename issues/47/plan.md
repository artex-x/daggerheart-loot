# Issue #47 - vanilla JS to Svelte + TypeScript

Source: [issue #47](https://github.com/artex-x/daggerheart-loot/issues/47). That
issue is the agreed plan; this file is the working copy, plus the decisions
taken while carrying it out. Where the two differ, the difference is written
down here with a reason.

Historical once the cut-over is done. After that, work is driven by `CLAUDE.md`,
`docs/specs/*` and the tests.

## What must survive

Static site, no server, no build required to open it, lists in the URL hash,
two languages, GitHub Pages, `file://`. These are in `docs/specs/META.md` and
`docs/specs/CONTRACTS.md`, which outlive this file.

## Phases

| Phase | What | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Baseline, inventory, durable specs, golden fixtures, coverage matrix | **done** |
| 1 | Vite + Svelte + TypeScript scaffold, quality gates, CI, contracts frozen | **done** |
| 2 | Extract pure logic to TypeScript modules with unit tests | **done** |
| 3 | Ports for replaceable concerns (drag and drop, search, modal) | **done** |
| 4 | Svelte component architecture, styling, i18n, the rewrite itself | **in progress** - see below |
| 5 | Testing pyramid: unit, component, a11y, e2e | largely arrived early, see below |
| 6 | Build, artefacts, deployment | started: the build now completes `dist/` |
| 7 | Cut-over, cleanup, README, standing agent guidance | not started |

## Phase 4 - where the rewrite is

Built, and matching the live app exactly in both languages at all three widths:

| Screen | Route | States compared |
|---|---|---|
| Record page | `#/i/<id>` | page, whole page, both languages, three widths |
| Wondrous | `#/roll/wondrous` | page, modal, help, stepper, pin toggle |
| Dread | `#/roll/dread` | page |
| Vault of Ages | `#/roll/voa` | page, the artifacts division |
| Communities | `#/roll/community` | page, a second community |
| Core rules | `#/roll/std` | page, one source off, one kind off |

Not built. Each is `pending` in `tests/parity/specs.js`, so the expectation is
already being collected against the live app:

- `#/roll/alt` - the alternate tables, the last roll mode
- `#/tables`, `#/tables/eq_weapon` - the tables slice
- `#/lists` - the lists slice
- `#/search` - the search slice
- `#/print/ci1-q1` - the print slice

### What every remaining `VISUAL_DEBT` entry is

Nothing outstanding is a styling defect. The 36 entries are three causes:

1. **The add-to-list and print row** under every record card - both record
   routes, the whole-page state and the modal. It is code that does not exist
   yet and lands with the lists and print slices, not polish to be chased.
2. **The toast**, on `~ pinned`. The live app raises one when the starting
   section changes; the rewrite announces it to a screen reader only.
   `#/i/ci1 ~ toast` is `pending` for the same gap.
3. **Help-panel rasterisation**, 0.29-0.79%. Measured, not guessed: the box,
   every paragraph, every line box and the colour are identical to three
   decimals and the text matches character for character. There is no value to
   copy - do not go looking for one.

## Phase 5 - what already exists

The pyramid arrived alongside Phase 4 rather than after it:

- 525 unit and component tests, per-file coverage thresholds
- `app/src/components/a11y.test.ts` - axe on **pressed** states, plus a guard
  that fails when a component has no named state rendering it under axe
- `tests/parity.js` - the rewrite against the live app, every state in both
  languages at three widths

What is left of Phase 5 is Playwright, and it is worth asking whether it is
still needed: the parity harness already drives both apps in a real browser.

## Decisions taken while working

### `base: './'`, not `base: '/daggerheart-loot/'`

Phase 1 item 6 of the issue asks for the absolute Pages base path. That
contradicts the `file://` requirement stated in the same issue's opening
constraints: an absolute base breaks every asset URL when the page is opened
from a folder. Relative URLs work identically on Pages, so nothing is lost.
Recorded in `docs/specs/META.md` section 4.

Consequences: one classic IIFE bundle rather than modules (Chrome refuses
modules over `file://`), no code splitting, `data.js` stays a classic script
assigning `window.LOOT`, and a build smoke check opens the built page from a
folder.

### Publishing is not gated by CI until Pages is switched over

GitHub's own `pages-build-deployment` publishes the configured branch on every
push regardless of Actions. Nothing in a workflow can prevent that. The fix is
**Settings -> Pages -> Source: GitHub Actions**, after which the `deploy` job in
`ci.yml` is the only route and it `needs: [check, audit, secrets]`.

**Still outstanding on the repository owner's side.** Until it is flipped, a red
build can go live.

### Parity compares states, not routes

A route only ever reaches the first paint, in the default language, at one
width, above the fold. That is how the modal shipped four times too wide with
none of the card's buttons while every check stayed green. `STATES` is now
multiplied by `LANGS` and `WIDTHS`, so a state written for one reason is checked
for five more, and a debt is keyed `"<id> @ <lang> <width>"`.

The full rule, and what the run measures about itself, is in `CLAUDE.md` under
"This is a refactor, not a redesign".

### The pre-commit hook was removed

It ran `eslint --fix` over staged files: over 150 seconds for three of them on a
mounted working copy, against 3.5 for prettier, and eslint's own CPU time was
half a second - the cost is reading `node_modules`, not linting. It was also a
strict subset of `npm run check`, which CI runs on every push, so the only thing
it added was a reason to pass `--no-verify`. A guard that gets waved through is
worse than no guard.

### The build completes `dist/`

`dist/` never contained `img/`, `og/` or `card/`; the build emits the
application and the pictures are made outside it. Invisible until Core rules
made the opening screen draw four cards, at which point the `file://` smoke run
failed on five missing `.webp`. A `closeBundle` hook links the three folders in -
linked rather than copied, because 80 MB per build is not worth paying for a
folder that has not changed, and `junction` makes that work on Windows without
elevation. `tests/parity.js` used to lay the same links itself; that workaround
is gone.

### A red run has to leave something to read

Every suite's whole output goes to `test-output/<name>.log`, and the workflow
uploads that directory - with `dist/` and `coverage/` - whenever the job fails.

### Phase 0 kept the puppeteer suites

The plan moves to Vitest and Playwright. The existing suites are the baseline
the migration is measured against, so they stay until the code they test is
gone. `tests/contracts.js` is written in the same style deliberately - it has to
run today, against the current app, or it is not a baseline.

## Working rules during the migration

From the issue, unchanged:

- repo files are authoritative; do not depend on chat history
- small vertical slices, each with its own tests
- never break a public contract without updating fixtures, `CONTRACTS.md`,
  `llms.txt` and the tests in the same change
- update `docs/specs/*` in the change that alters behaviour, not afterwards
- pure logic free of Svelte and DOM; ports for replaceable behaviour
- strict TypeScript, `any` is an error
- scoped CSS and tokens, plain CSS only
- never infer a tier from stats
- every defect fix gets a test
- bad deploys are fixed by `git revert`
