# 2026-09-18 - Share stubs (`i/`) and artwork (`img/`, `og/`) stay tracked root folders

- Task: `untrack-stubs` (retired; recorded here at retirement).
- Decision: `i/*.html`, `img/`, and `og/` stay tracked at the repository
  root rather than moving under a build output or out of git entirely.
- Rejected: generating stubs into `dist/i/` and dropping the root folder
  (moves a path four suites read off disk - `derived`, `dataint`, `craft`,
  `stub` - and changes what `node tools/build.js` means); git-lfs, a
  shallow-clone recommendation, or a history rewrite for repository size
  (the 146 MB `.git` is `img/` + `og/`, which stay tracked regardless of
  this choice; a rewrite breaks every clone and every sha the specs cite).
- Superseded for i/ by f53f44d, which untracked the stubs (.gitignore,
  CONTRACTS.md section 5); img/ and og/ stay tracked as decided.
