# 2026-09-18 - The task-document size budget and compaction stay; retirement becomes primary

- Task: `workflow-hygiene`.
- Decision: the 150 KB warn / 300 KB collapse budget and its compaction
  procedure (`.claude/skills/handoff/SKILL.md`) stay - they guard the *open*
  task, read by every worker at dispatch. Compaction becomes the secondary
  procedure; retirement (deleting the directory at closeout) becomes primary.
- Rejected: dropping compaction now that retirement exists - a long task
  still grows for weeks before it closes (phase 8 ran twelve batches), so
  the mid-task budget problem compaction solves has not gone away.
