# 2026-09-18 - The comment standard lives in `CLAUDE.md`, enforced by review and rule 2i, no new hook yet

- Task: `workflow-hygiene`.
- Decision: the four-bullet comment standard (`CLAUDE.md`, "Comments") is
  enforced by the review prompt (section G) and, at retirement, by rule 2i -
  a comment citing `issues/<id>/` blocks the directory's deletion, and the
  writer of that comment pays for it.
- Rejected: a dedicated hook or `tests/` gate now - the written rule has not
  been given a chance to fail yet (`.claude/README.md`'s standing bar for a
  new hook is a repeated mistake, row 29). `.claude/README.md` row 48
  records the cheapest deterministic form for the day it does.
