# 2026-09-17 - The R0c sweep ran as a read-only reviewer-role dispatch, not an implementer step

- Task: the Svelte migration (issue 47; retired, recorded here at
  retirement).
- Decision: the sweep that read the deleted instruments' own assertions for
  what no surviving instrument could see ran as a read-only, reviewer-role
  dispatch, deliberately separate from the implementer batch that did the
  deleting - the implementer's incentive is to delete, which is the wrong
  incentive for a read meant to find what deleting loses.
- Rejected: a gate in `npm run check` (there is nothing mechanical to
  assert - the sweep's findings are read-only prose); the implementer doing
  it in the same batch (anchoring - the same person who wants the deletion
  reviewing what it costs); skipping it because an earlier audit (R0b)
  already covered ten suites (that audit covered suites, not markup,
  conditional CSS, the dictionary, or the 42 parity specs the sweep also
  read).
- Evidence: this generalises to any "delete a whole surface" batch, not only
  R0c's own.
