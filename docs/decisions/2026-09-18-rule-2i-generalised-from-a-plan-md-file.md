# 2026-09-18 - Rule 2i generalised from a plan.md file to any task directory

- Task: `workflow-hygiene`.
- Decision: `bash-guard.mjs` rule 2i now denies `rm`/`git rm` of any file
  under `issues/<id>/`, or of the directory itself, while a tracked line
  outside that directory cites `issues/<id>/` (a `git show <sha>:path`
  citation stays exempt) - generalised from denying only a still-cited
  `plan.md`.
- Rejected: retiring the rule instead, on the theory that "nothing may cite
  a task directory" under the new model - a rule nobody enforces at the
  moment of deletion is exactly the rule that produced ten orphaned
  citations for issue 65's retired `plan.md`.
- Evidence: retirement was rare before this task (three directories ever)
  and is now routine (every task's closeout), so the class of orphan the
  rule prevents is attempted at every closeout, not occasionally.
